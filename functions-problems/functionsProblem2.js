/*
Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels within the string.
Hint: use the "spilt", the Array#includes method and, a "for" loop or "forEach" loop.
1.  create  a variable that represents all vowels.
2.  create a base line count variable that represents 0.
3.  create a function that allows me to pass in a string parmeter as a argument. 
Within the function:
4.  create a For Loop that loops through the array and iterates one at a time.  
5.  go through the string and search for vowels.
6.  create a split()method for the words in the array.
7.  return the total number of matches found.
